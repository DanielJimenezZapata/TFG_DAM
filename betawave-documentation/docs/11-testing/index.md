This document outlines the testing strategies and methodologies employed to ensure the proper functioning of the BETAWAVE project. It details the various types of tests conducted, the tools used, and the results obtained.

## Testing Strategies

1. **Unit Testing**: 
   - Each module of the application was tested individually to ensure that each component functions as expected.
   - Tools used: [insert testing framework/tool here].

2. **Integration Testing**: 
   - After unit testing, integration tests were performed to verify that different modules work together seamlessly.
   - Tools used: [insert testing framework/tool here].

3. **System Testing**: 
   - The complete system was tested to ensure that it meets the specified requirements.
   - Tools used: [insert testing framework/tool here].

4. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: 
   - End-users tested the application to validate that it meets their needs and requirements.
   - Feedback was collected and used for further improvements.

## Testing Tools

- [List any testing tools or frameworks used, e.g., Jest, Mocha, Selenium, etc.]

## Results

- Summary of the testing results, including any issues found and how they were resolved.
- [Insert any relevant metrics or statistics related to testing, e.g., test coverage, number of bugs found, etc.]

## Conclusion

The testing phase was crucial in ensuring the reliability and functionality of the BETAWAVE project. Continuous testing and feedback loops will be maintained to enhance the system further.
